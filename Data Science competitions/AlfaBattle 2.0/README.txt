Hello!
This is my solution for the second task of AlfaBattle 2.0 (link: https://boosters.pro/championship/alfabattle2/overview) 

The structure is the following:
------ EDA - file with some exploritary data analysis
------ functions_and_workings - file where I create features, fit the model and make predictions.

------ raw_file - very raw file where I did my calculations. Since the first 2 are more representative, but calculations were made here, I need to upload it only the ensure that the work was really done.
