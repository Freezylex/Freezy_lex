Hello!
This is my solution for the second task of AlfaBattle 2.0 (link: https://boosters.pro/championship/alfabattle2/overview) 

The structure is the following:
------EDA - file with some exploritary data analysis
------workings_and_functions - file where I create features, fit the model and make predictions.
