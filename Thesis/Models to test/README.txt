Folder with all models that have been tested. Structure:

1) Macro + LM in FD_[old], Macro + LM_[old], Rolling window_[old] - models before implementation of Slope, Level and Curvature factors.
These models are built in first differences, without differencing and using rolling window of factors (accordingly). NOT FINAL ONES.

2) Final model - model used in thesis. Additional tests were constructed in STATA.
